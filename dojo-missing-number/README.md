# The Ultimate Missing Number Challenge
```Welcome to the Ultimate Missing Number Challenge! We have a big array of distinct numbers ranging from 0 to n, but one number is missing. Can you figure out which one it is? Remember, you have to use O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity, and you have to write your solution in GO.```

## Example 1
### Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

## Example 2
### Input: [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

## Example 3
### Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8

Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Constraints
All the numbers of nums are unique.
